# Gold-price-detection
Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model that leverages historical gold price data and other relevant information to forecast future gold prices. The model will utilize LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), which is well-suited for capturing complex patterns and relationships in time series data like gold prices. By accurately predicting gold prices, this model can be of significant value to investors, traders, and individuals involved in the gold market, allowing them to make more informed investment decisions.

Approach
To achieve the goal of predicting gold prices, the project will follow these steps:

Data Collection: Obtain historical gold price data and other relevant features that may influence the price of gold, such as economic indicators, currency values, and stock market trends.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize the features, and ensure they are in a suitable format for LSTM model training.

LSTM Model Training: Implement the LSTM model using Python and suitable deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Train the model on the preprocessed data, allowing it to learn the complex patterns in the historical gold prices.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the LSTM model using appropriate metrics and techniques, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), to measure the accuracy of its predictions.

Future Price Prediction: Utilize the trained LSTM model to make predictions on future gold prices based on the input data and the captured patterns.

Visualization: Visualize the predicted gold prices along with the historical data to provide a clear representation of the model's performance.

Model Variance Analysis: Analyze the variance of the LSTM model's predictions to understand its reliability and provide insights into potential risk and uncertainty.
